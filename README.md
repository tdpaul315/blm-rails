Welcome to the BLM App where you can join our existing movements or create your own! Meet other like minded individuals and peacefully protest for your cause!

INTRODUCTION: THE BLM App sole purpose is to provide a resource to people who are passionate about movements across the world and want to take action via peaceful demonstrations. The site is still in development so any pull requests are welcome! 

APP BACKGROUND: To solve the issue of not having any way to join movements from the comfort of home, BLM App was thought of amongst a family of four who wanted to take action in the community, spread awareness and encouragement. In November of 2020, the four mapped out all of the details and brought them to life.
